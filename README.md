# Security-Assignment
In this assignment, I was given a vulnerabe Cent0S 5.5 installation, and tasked with finding, and providing solutions for, 7 or more vulnerabilities. As the CentOS 5.5 installation is private property of the University I attend, I cannot unfortunately provide it here. The finished report can be found in Report.pdf.
